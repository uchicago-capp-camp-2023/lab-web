# Pre-Installation

_Where do programmers write and test their code?_ You have likely used commercial word processors like Apple Pages or Microsoft Word to compose documents, spreadsheet applications like Microsoft Excel to filter datasets, and visualization products like Tableau and Power BI to generate charts and statistics. What applications are commonly used for coding workflows?

Although command-line text editors like Vim and graphical text editors like Sublime Text and Atom are popular, we will rely on integrated development environments (IDEs) for CAPP Camp and CAPP 30121. IDEs are software applications that consolidate the functionality of text editors and terminals into a single graphical user interface (GUI). They also provide additional features like syntax highlighting, autocompletion, and code debugging out-of-the-box, which boosts programmers' productivity.

For the camp and computer applications intro sequence, we will be using Visual Studio Code (VS Code), a popular IDE created by Microsoft. In our first lab, we will learn how to use VS Code to connect to the university's computers, edit Python and text files, and execute Python scripts. Before getting started, you will need to first download the prerequisite software programs.

## Instructions

Please follow the instructions linked below for your operating system to install (1) VS Code, (2) an SSH (Secure Shell) client, and (3) the "Remote-SSH" and Python VS Code extensions:

- [Windows](./1-windows.md)
- [MacOS](./2-mac.md)
- [Linux](./3-linux.md)

If you run into any problems during the installation process, please reach out to staff on [Ed](https://edstem.org/us/courses/42535/discussion/) by making a new thread.
