# Python Programming

_What is a programming language?_ While natural languages like English, Spanish, and Vietnamese evolve organically over time, formal languages are designed by humans for specific applications. They are nearly always literal in meaning and based on a strict, unambiguous set of rules. A programming language is a type of formal language that communicates a set of instructions to a computer.

In CAPP 30121, you will use the programming language _Python_ to read data, write data, and implement different algorithms to process that data. Our lab begins with a high-level overview of  Python's history and usage and then teases some of its basic data structures. With this background understanding in place, we then tour the various features VS Code offers to improve programming efficiency and user accessibility. Finally, we review how to plan, write, and test code for homework assignments. As an exercise, you will complete and submit a mock assignment for grading.

Let's get started!

## Objectives

1. Learn about Python's history, popularity, and relevance to future coursework as well as a few of its built-in data types and control flow structures.

2. Learn about VS Code features that improve Python development, including rulers, multiple terminals, split windows, linting, IntelliSense, and keyboard shortcuts.

3. Configure your instance of VS Code for greater accessibilty and productivity.

4. Review and practice the process of planning, writing, testing, and submitting code for programming assignments.
