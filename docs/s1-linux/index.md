# Introduction to Linux

Linux is an operating system (OS) much like macOS or Windows. It has windows, programs, web browsers, and so on. Files are stored in directories (folders) that, in turn, are stored in other directories. Although you can access Linux's features using your mouse, as you perform more and more complex tasks, you will find that using the mouse is ineffective. Linux allows us to interact with the computer entirely through text using a program called the _terminal_. (Macs provide a similar terminal application, and there are ways to use text-based commands on Windows too. But Linux provides the lowest barrier to entry.)

In this lab, you will learn how to use the terminal to perform some basic operations in Linux. You will need these skills for the rest of your time at UChicago.


## Objectives

1. Connect to your assigned Linux server.

2. Become familiar with the Linux environment.

3. Learn basic terminal commands and how to work with a text editor.

4. Learn about redirection and pipes.

5. Learn to run a Python program from the command-line.

6. Learn keyboard shortcuts to boost programming productivity.
