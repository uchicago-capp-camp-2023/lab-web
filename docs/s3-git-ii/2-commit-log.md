# Looking at the commit log

Once you have made multiple commits, you can see these commits, their dates, commit messages, author, etc. by typing `git log`. This command will open a scrollable interface (using the up/down arrow keys) that shows every commit you have made so far in the repository. You can get out this interface by pressing the `q` key. As we saw earlier, you can also see the history of commits through GitHubâ€™s web interface, but it is also useful to be able to access the commit log directly from the terminal, without having to open a browser.

Run the command `git log` from either the repository in your home directory (`/home/USER/capp30121/camp-1-YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME`) or in the temp directory (`/tmp/USER/capp30121/camp-1-YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME`). You should see output that looks something like this

```

```

Each commit has a _commit hash_ (usually referred to as the _commit SHA_) that looks something like this:

```
7abeffd2ba2a00ed697b25d90af18bd803d44588
```

This is a unique identifier that we can use to refer to a commit elsewhere. For example, choose any commit from the commit log and run the following:

```
git show COMMIT_SHA
```

Make sure to replace `COMMIT_SHA` with a commit SHA that appears in your commit log.

This command will show you the changes that were included in that commit. The output of `git show` can be a bit hard to parse at first but the most important thing to take into account is that any line starting with a `+` denotes a line that was added, and any line starting with a `-` denotes a line that was removed. (Recall that this is the same formatting we saw when [using `git diff`](../s2-git-i/5-discarding-changes-unstaging.html) to show the pending changes to a file in the first Git lab.)

{: .tip}
> In any place where you have to refer to a commit SHA, you can just write the first few characters of the commit SHA. For example, for commit `9119c6ffcebc2e3540d587180236aaf1222ee63c` we could write just this:
>
> ```
> git show 9119c6f
> ```
> Git will only complain if there is more than one commit that starts with that same prefix.
